In mathematics, the **Fibonacci numbers** are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:

    **1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 34, 55, 89, 144...**
    
By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
